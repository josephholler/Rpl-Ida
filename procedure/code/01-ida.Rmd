## Set up environment

Load the R project saved in the root directory of this repository, so that the
working directory is the root directory of the repository.

```{r setup, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# install r version from 9-10-2021
if(!require(groundhog)){
  install.packages("groundhog")
  require(groundhog)
}

if(!require(here)){
  install.packages("here")
  require(here)
}

groundhog.day <- "2021-09-10"
set.groundhog.folder(here("data", "scratch", "groundhog"))

groundhog.library(packages, groundhog.day)
# list of required packages
packages <- c(
  "here", "svDialogs", "tidyverse",
  "tidytext", "tm", "igraph", "ggraph",
  "tidycensus", "sf", "spdep"
)


# additional packages: test which are still needed:
# "maps", "tm", "RColorBrewer", "rccmisc",

# load and install required packages
package_check <- lapply(
  packages,
  FUN = function(x) {
    if (!require(x, character.only = TRUE)) {
      install.packages(x, dependencies = TRUE, quietly = TRUE)
      library(x, character.only = TRUE)
    }
  }
)
```

```{r}
# installing a previous version of rtweet
# in 2021, would have been version 0.7.0. In Nov 2023, we're on 1.1.0

# Install the 'remotes' package if you haven't already
install.packages("remotes")

# Load the 'remotes' package
library(remotes)

# Install a specific version of 'rtweet'
#detach("package:rtweet", unload = TRUE)
library(devtools)
install_version("rtweet", version = "0.7.0")
library(rtweet)

# save the R processing environment
# writeLines(
#   capture.output(sessionInfo()),
#   here("procedure", "environment", "r_environment.txt")
# )
```

## Set up Twitter Application

You will need Twitter Developer API access to run this analysis:
See https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/vignettes/auth.html for
instructions.

reference for search_tweets function: 
https://rtweet.info/reference/search_tweets.html 
- don't add any spaces in between variable name and value for your search  
e.g. n=1000 is better than n = 1000
- the first parameter in quotes is the search string
- `n=10000` asks for 10,000 tweets
- if you want more than 18,000 tweets, change `retryonratelimit` to `TRUE` and 
wait 15 minutes for every batch of 18,000
- `include_rts=FALSE` excludes retweets.
- `token` refers to the twitter token you defined above for access to your 
twitter developer account
- `geocode` is equal to a string with three parts: longitude, latitude, and 
distance with the units mi for miles or km for kilometers

This code block will ask you for your twitter application name, key, and secret.
Then it will launch a web browser and prompt you to log in to Twitter to 
authenticate the application.

Never save your API keys in code where it can be committed and synced to GitHub!
The code below is configured to save your keys in the environment, and this Git
repository is set up to ignore the R environment data file.

```{r twitter-setup, eval = FALSE}
# Twitter application values
twitter_vars <- list(
  app = "enter Twitter application name",
  key = "enter Twitter API key",
  secret = "enter Twitter API secret key"
)

# if Twitter token has already been created, auto-fill dialogue with its values
if (exists("twitter_token")) {
  twitter_vars$app <- twitter_token$app$appname
  twitter_vars$key <- twitter_token$app$key
  twitter_vars$secret <- twitter_token$app$secret
}

twitter_token <- create_token(
  app = dlgInput("Twitter App Name:", twitter_vars$app)$res,
  consumer_key = dlgInput("Consumer Key:", twitter_vars$key)$res,
  consumer_secret = dlgInput("Consumer Secret:", twitter_vars$secret)$res,
  access_token = NULL,
  access_secret = NULL
)
```

# Pre-processing

- Acquire Twitter data for analysis
- Filter Twitter data for good geographic information and convert to Lat/Long
coordinates

## Search for Hurricane event tweets

get tweets for hurricane Ida, searched on `02-Sept-2021`
**Warning**: this code will no longer result in the same data! 
It is here for reference or replication work only.

```{r search-event, eval = FALSE}
tevent_raw <- search_tweets("ida OR hurricane",
  n = 200000, include_rts = TRUE,
  token = twitter_token,
  geocode = "36,-87,1000mi",
  retryonratelimit = TRUE
)

# write status id's for results of the original twitter search
write.table(tevent_raw$status_id,
  here("data", "raw", "public", "teventids.txt"),
  append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)

saveRDS(tevent_raw, here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw.RDS") )
```

## Second search for more temporal coverage
get tweets for hurricane Ida, searched on `05-Sept-2021`

```{r search-event-again, eval = FALSE}
tevent_raw2 <- search_tweets("ida OR hurricane",
  n = 200000, include_rts = TRUE,
  token = twitter_token,
  geocode = "36,-87,1000mi",
  retryonratelimit = TRUE
)

# write status id's for results of the original twitter search
write.table(tevent_raw2$status_id,
  here("data", "raw", "public", "teventids2.txt"),
  append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)

saveRDS(tevent_raw2, here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw2.RDS") )
```

## Third search for more temporal coverage
get tweets for hurricane Ida, searched on `10-Sept-2021`

```{r search-event-again, eval = FALSE}
tevent_raw3 <- search_tweets("ida OR hurricane",
  n = 200000, include_rts = TRUE,
  token = twitter_token,
  geocode = "36,-87,1000mi",
  retryonratelimit = TRUE
)

# write status id's for results of the original twitter search
write.table(tevent_raw3$status_id,
  here("data", "raw", "public", "teventids3.txt"),
  append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)

saveRDS(tevent_raw3, here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw3.RDS") )
```

## Fourth search for different thematic coverage
get tweets for hurricane Ida, searched on `10-Sept-2021`

```{r search-event-again, eval = FALSE}
tevent_raw4 <- search_tweets("ida OR flood OR electricity OR recovery OR outage",
  n = 200000, include_rts = TRUE,
  token = twitter_token,
  geocode = "36,-87,1000mi",
  retryonratelimit = TRUE
)

# write status id's for results of the original twitter search
write.table(tevent_raw4$status_id,
  here("data", "raw", "public", "teventids4.txt"),
  append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)

saveRDS(tevent_raw4, here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw4.RDS") )
```

## Visualize geographic region of search queries
```{r}

center <- data.frame(lon = -87, lat = 36)
center_sf <- st_as_sf(center, coords = c("lon","lat"), crs = 4326)
center_buff <- st_buffer(center_sf, 1609000)

# template from hotspot results 
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties, color = "black", fill="white", lwd = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = center_buff, color = "red", fill = NA) +
  labs(title = "Twitter Search Query Region") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Search for generic tweets after hurricane season

get tweets without any text filter for the same geographic region in tdcontrol, 
searched on tdcontrol 19, 2019
the query searches for all verified or unverified tweets, i.e. everything

**Warning**: this code will no longer result in the same data! 
It is here for reference or replication work only.

```{r search-tdcontrol, eval = FALSE}
tdcontrol_raw <- search_tweets("-filter:verified OR filter:verified",
  n = 200000, include_rts = FALSE,
  token = twitter_token,
  geocode = "32,-78,1000mi",
  retryonratelimit = TRUE
)

# write status id's for results of the original twitter search
write.table(tdcontrol_raw$status_id,
  here("data", "raw", "public", "tdcontrolids.txt"),
  append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)
```

## Rehydrate the twitter data

Twitter does not permit redistribution of Twitter data, with the exception of 
tweet status ids. 
For the purposes of transparency and reproducibility, 
researchers may include a list of status id's with their publication. 
The process of using those status ids to query Twitter for the full tweet data 
is called **rehydrating**&mdash;like going back to the analogous fire hose of 
big data.
**Warning**: Twitter users and individual tweets can be deleted over time, 
therefore the results of rehydration will be similar, but not identical to, the
original Twitter data used for this research.  
**Warning**: It may take more than an hour to rehydrate the raw tweets with 
Twitter queries, therefore you may select to load only the derived status ids,
which have filtered only the tweets with valid geographic data (approximately 
one tenth of the raw tweets)

### Load Twitter status ids

```{r load-original-statusids, eval = FALSE}
# load tweet status id's for Hurricane event search results

filtered <- dlgList(
  choices = c("raw", "derived"), 
  title = "Which Dorin ids?")$res

teventids <-
  data.frame(read.table(here("data", filtered, "public", "teventids.txt"),
    numerals = "no.loss"
  ))

filtered <- dlgList(
  choices = c("raw", "derived"), 
  title = "Which Dorin ids?")$res

# load cleaned status id's for tdcontrol general twitter search
tdcontrolids <-
  data.frame(read.table(here("data", "raw", "public", "tdcontrolids.txt"),
    numerals = "no.loss"
  ))
```

### Rehydrate Twitter status ids
This operation may take over an hour to run on all of the raw tweets

```{r rehydrate, eval = FALSE}
# rehydrate event tweets
tevent_raw <- rehydratoR(twitter_token$app$key, twitter_token$app$secret,
  twitter_token$credentials$oauth_token,
  twitter_token$credentials$oauth_secret, teventids,
  base_path = NULL, group_start = 1
)

# rehydrate tdcontrol tweets
tdcontrol_raw <- rehydratoR(twitter_token$app$key, twitter_token$app$secret,
  twitter_token$credentials$oauth_token,
  twitter_token$credentials$oauth_secret, tdcontrolids,
  base_path = NULL, group_start = 1
)
``` 

## Load the original search results

Students in the GEOG 323 Open Source GIScience course may download the original
search results from the private course data repository: 
...

Save the two `.RDS` files to the `data/raw/private` folder and then load the
data with the code block below.

```{r load-original}
tevent_raw <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw.RDS"))
tevent_raw2 <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw2.RDS"))
tevent_raw3 <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw3.RDS"))
tevent_raw4 <- readRDS(here("data", "raw", "private", "tevent_raw4.RDS"))
```

## Process geographic data in tweets 

reference for lat_lng function: https://rtweet.info/reference/lat_lng.html
adds a lat and long field to the data frame, picked out of the fields
that you indicate in the c() list
sample function: lat_lng(x, coords = c("coords_coords", "bbox_coords"))

list and count unique place types
NA results included based on profile locations, not geotagging / geocoding.
If you have these, it indicates that you exhausted the more precise tweets 
in your search parameters and are including locations based on user profiles

### Combine searches

```{r combine-searches, eval = FALSE}
tevent_raw <- rbind(tevent_raw, tevent_raw2, tevent_raw3, tevent_raw4) %>% 
  distinct(status_id, .keep_all=TRUE)
rm(tevent_raw2, tevent_raw3, tevent_raw4)
```

```{r count-place-types}
count(tevent_raw, place_type)
```

### Convert geographic information into lat/long coordinates

If you have loaded filtered status ids, or you have already run this code, you
will not notice a difference in `place_type` or `n` because the data has already
been processed.

First, convert `coords_coords` (from location services) to `lat`,`lng` 
coordinates.  
Second, filter only the records with location services-based lat and long,
or place designated to the city, neighborhood, or POI level.  
Third, convert the place to lat,lng. By default, this does not overwrite
lat and long  
*Caution*: Do not use `geo_coords` or Lat/Lng will be inverted!

```{r event-lat-long}
# convert geographic information for event into lat,lng coordinates
tevent <- tevent_raw %>% 
  lat_lng(coords = c("coords_coords")) %>% 
  subset(place_type == "city" | place_type == "neighborhood" | 
    place_type == "poi" | !is.na(lat)
  ) %>% 
  lat_lng(coords = c("bbox_coords"))
  
# re-check counts of place types
count(tevent, place_type)
```

Convert geographic information to `lat`,`lng` for control tweets

```{r control-lat-long, eval = FALSE}
# convert geographic information for control into lat,lng coordinates
tdcontrol <- tdcontrol_raw %>% 
  lat_lng(coords = c("coords_coords")) %>% 
  subset(place_type == "city" | place_type == "neighborhood" | 
    place_type == "poi" | !is.na(lat)
  ) %>% 
  lat_lng(coords = c("bbox_coords"))
```

### Save processed tweets

Optionally,
Save the tweet id's to the `data\derived\public` folder as plain text.  
Save the full tweet data to `data\derived\private` folder as RDS files.  
Full Tweet data cannot be shared with the public, therefore it is stored in
a folder ignored by Git.

```{r save-processed-tweets, eval = FALSE}
# save event data
write.table(tevent$status_id,
  here("data", "derived", "public", "teventids.txt"),
  append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)
saveRDS(tevent, here("data", "derived", "private", "tevent_all.RDS"))

# save control data
write.table(tdcontrol$status_id,
  here("data", "derived", "public", "tdcontrolids.txt"),
  append = FALSE, quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE
)
saveRDS(tdcontrol, here("data", "derived", "private", "tdcontrol.RDS"))
```



### Load processed tweets

Optionally,
Load processed twitter data

```{r load-processed-tweets}
tevent <- readRDS(here("data", "derived", "private", "tevent_all.RDS"))
```


# Temporal Analysis

Create a temporal data frame and graph it

```{r temporal}
tevent_tweets_by_hour <- ts_data(tevent, by = "hours")
ts_plot(tevent, by = "hours")
```

# Network Analysis

Create a network data frame. 
Other options for 'edges' in the network include mention, retweet, and reply
The graph does not look good (understatement), because of poor data regarding quotes.
It would be more interesting to visualize retweets, but we did not search for
them, as we were focusing on original content.

```{r network}
tevent_network <- tevent %>% 
  network_graph("retweet,quote") %>% 
  simplify(remove.multiple = FALSE)

tevent_network <- delete.vertices(
  tevent_network,
  degree(tevent_network, mode="in") < 1
  ) %>% 
  simplify()

tevent_network <- delete.vertices(
  tevent_network,
  degree(tevent_network) == 0
  )

plot.igraph(
    tevent_network,
    vertex.size = 4,
    vertex.label = ifelse(
      degree(tevent_network) > 2, 
      V(tevent_network)$name, ""), 
    vertex.label.cex = 0.8, 
    edge.arrow.mode = "->",
    edge.arrow.size = 0.1
  )
```

# Text Analysis

## Clean the text data

Parse the tweet data for plain language, and parse tweet text into words.
Remove stop words and our search terms.

```{r text-processing}
# remove urls, fancy formatting, etc. in other words, clean the text content
tevent_text <- tevent %>%
  select(text) %>%
  plain_tweets()

# parse out words from tweet text
tevent_words <- tevent_text %>% unnest_tokens(word, text)

# how many words do you have including the stop words?
word_count <- list(before = count(tevent_words)$n)

# create list of stop words (useless words not worth analyzing)
data("stop_words")

# add "t.co" twitter links to the list of stop words
# also add the twitter search terms to the list
# it would have been better to store a list of search terms to use here
stop_words <- stop_words %>%
  add_row(word = "t.co", lexicon = "SMART") %>%
  add_row(word = "hurricane", lexicon = "Search") %>%
  add_row(word = "ida", lexicon = "Search") %>%
  add_row(word = "sharpiegate", lexicon = "Search") %>%
  add_row(word = "hurricaneida", lexicon = "Search")

# delete stop words from tevent_words with an anti_join
tevent_words <- anti_join(tevent_words, stop_words, by="word")

# how many words after removing the stop words?
word_count <- append(
  word_count,
  list(after = count(tevent_words)$n)
  )
print(word_count)
```

## Graph frequencies of words

```{r word-frequency}
tevent_words %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 15) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = word, y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "Count",
    y = "Unique words",
    title = "Count of unique words found in tweets"
  )
```

## Analyze and graph word assoctiation

```{r word-association}
# separate words and count frequency of word pair occurrence in tweets
tevent_word_pairs <- tevent_text %>%
  mutate(text = removeWords(tolower(text), stop_words$word)) %>%
  unnest_tokens(paired_words, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2) %>%
  separate(paired_words, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ") %>%
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)

# graph a word cloud with space indicating association.
# you may change the filter to filter more or less than pairs with 25 instances
tevent_word_pairs %>%
  filter(n >= 20 & !is.na(word1) & !is.na(word2)) %>%
  graph_from_data_frame() %>%
  ggraph(layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(edge_alpha = n, edge_width = n)) +
  geom_node_point(color = "darkslategray4", size = 3) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), vjust = 1.8, size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Word Network of Tweets during Hurricane event",
    x = "", y = ""
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(
    fill = "grey95",
    colour = "black",
    size = 1
    ),
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "grey95")
  )
```

## Spatial Analysis

First, you will need a Census API. You can sign up for one here: https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html

```{r census-api}
census_api_key(dlgInput(
  "Enter a Census API Key",
  Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY")
)$res,
overwrite = TRUE,
install = TRUE
)

counties <- get_estimates(
  "county",
  product = "population",
  output = "wide",
  geometry = TRUE,
  keep_geo_vars = TRUE
)
```

## Select and save counties of interest

select only the states you want, with FIPS state codes
look up fips codes here: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standard_state_code 

```{r save-counties}
states <- c(
    "54", "51", "50", "47", "45", "44", "42", "39", "37", "36", "05", "01",
    "34", "33", "29", "28", "25", "24", "23", "22", "21", "18", "17", "13",
    "12", "11", "10", "09", "48", "40", "20", "19", "26", "55", "27")

counties <- filter(
  counties,
  STATEFP %in% states
)
# alternatively, one could select by location using original search criteria...

saveRDS(counties, here("data", "derived", "public", "counties.RDS"))
```

### Load counties

Optionally, load counties from the `counties.RDS` file saved with the repository

```{r load-counties, eval = FALSE}
counties <- readRDS(here("data", "derived", "public", "counties.RDS"))
```

## Baseline Census Data: Planned Deviation

### Census data for geographic region (counties in geographic region)
will move this to the pre-processing section but need to put this after counties and states for now
```{r}

# Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with the actual API key you obtained
api_key <- "b5840eb5af9044fef5f4bed8cb0d7420e9a6462d"

# # initialize variables vector with single digits that need leading zero
# census_vars <- c("B01001_001","B01001_007", "B01001_008", "B01001_009")
# 
# for (i in 10:49) {
#   varname <- paste("B01001_0",as.character(i),sep="")
#   census_vars <- c(census_vars, varname)
# }
# 
# # using tidycensus
# acs_data <- get_acs(geography = "county",
#                     year = 2021,
#                     variables = census_vars,
#                     states = states,
#                     survey = "acs5")
# 
# # pivot so each variable is a column
# acs_data_wide <- acs_data %>% 
#   pivot_wider(names_from = variable,
#               values_from = c(estimate, moe))
# 
# # could save raw census data here
# 
# # aggregate by Twitter age groups
# county_demog <- acs_data_wide %>% 
#   rename(total_pop = estimate_B01001_001) %>% 
#   select(GEOID, NAME, total_pop) %>% 
#   # mutate(
#   #        male_18_29 = rowSums(acs_data_wide[3:7]),
#   #        male_30_49 = rowSums(acs_data_wide[8:11]),
#   #        male_50_64 = rowSums(acs_data_wide[12:15]),
#   #        male_65_plus = rowSums(acs_data_wide[16:21]),
#   #        female_18_29 = rowSums(acs_data_wide[27:31]),
#   #        female_30_49 = rowSums(acs_data_wide[32:35]),
#   #        female_50_64 = rowSums(acs_data_wide[36:39]),
#   #        female_65_plus = rowSums(acs_data_wide[40:45]),
#   #        
#           # )
#   mutate(twitter_pop = total_pop/10000) # approx. number of twitter users
# 
# # join population data to counties data set
# 
# 

```

## Map Population Density and Tweet Points

map results with GGPlot
note: cut_interval is an equal interval classification function, while 
cut_number is a quantile / equal count function
you can change the colors, titles, and transparency of points

```{r map-tweet-points}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties, 
    aes(fill = cut_number(DENSITY, 5)), color = "grey") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "GnBu") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Population Density")) +
  geom_point(
    data = tevent, aes(x = lng, y = lat),
    colour = "purple", alpha = 0.1, size = 1
  ) +
  labs(title = "Tweet Locations During Hurricane Ida") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  xlim(-96, -67) +
  ylim(24, 47) 
```

## Join Tweets to Counties

Spatially join tevent tweets to counties with the following steps:

1. Make point geometries from `lat` and `lng` columns
2. Reproject points to `NAD 1983` geographic coordinate system
3. Join county `GEOID` to each tweet by location
4. Drop geometry of points
5. Group by county `GEOID`
6. Count number of tweets by county
7. Join number of tweets to counties
8. Replace missing values with 0
9. Calculate rate of spatial tweets per 10,000 people


```{r join-event-tweets-to-counties}
tevent_sf <- tevent %>%
  # optional temporal filter:
  # filter(created_at > as.POSIXct("2021-08-30 00:00:00")) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lng", "lat"), crs = 4326) %>% # make point geometries
  st_transform(4269) %>% # transform to NAD 1983
  st_join(select(counties, GEOID)) # spatially join county GEOID to each tweet

tevent_by_county <- tevent_sf %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>% # drop geometry / make simple table
  group_by(GEOID) %>% # group by county using GEOID
  summarise(event_tweets = n()) # count # of tweets

counties <- counties %>%
  left_join(tevent_by_county, by = "GEOID") %>%
  mutate(event_tweets = replace_na(event_tweets, 0),
         twitter_pop = POP/10000,
         tweetrate = event_tweets / twitter_pop)

```


Calculate normalized tweet difference index: `(event - control) / (event + control)`
```{r}
counties <- counties %>%
  mutate(ndti = (event_tweets - twitter_pop)/(event_tweets + twitter_pop)) %>% 
  mutate(ndti = replace_na(ndti, 0)) # replace NULLs with 0's
```



Save counties as `counties_tweet_counts.RDS`

```{r save-counties-tweet-counts}
# save counties geographic data with derived tweet rates
saveRDS(counties, here("data", "derived", "public", "counties_tweet_counts.RDS"))
```

Optionally, begin here by loading counties with Twitter data

```{r load-counties-with-twitter}
counties <- readRDS(here("data", "derived", "public", "counties_tweet_counts.RDS"))
```

### Plot NDTI using Census baseline 
```{r map ndti census}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties, 
    aes(fill = cut_interval(ndti, 5)), color = "grey", lwd=0.01) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "GnBu") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Normalized Difference Tweet Index")) +
  labs(title = "Hurricane Ida Twitter Activity") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  xlim(-96, -67) +
  ylim(24, 47)
```
```{r}
november <- readRDS(here("data", "derived", "private", "november.RDS"))

# double check november procedure

nov_by_county <- november %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lng", "lat"), crs = 4326) %>%
  st_transform(4269) %>%
  st_join(select(counties, GEOID)) %>%
  st_drop_geometry() %>%
  group_by(GEOID) %>%
  summarise(nov = n())

counties <- counties %>%
  left_join(nov_by_county, by = "GEOID") %>%
  mutate(nov = replace_na(nov, 0))

counties <- counties %>%
  mutate(ndti_nov = (event_tweets - nov) / (event_tweets + nov)) %>% # normalized diff tweet index
  mutate(ndti_nov = replace_na(ndti_nov, 0)) # replace NULLs with 0's

```

### Plot NDTI using November baseline
```{r map ndti november}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties, 
    aes(fill = cut_interval(ndti_nov, 5)), color = "grey", lwd=0.01) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "GnBu") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Normalized Difference Tweet Index")) +
  labs(title = "Hurricane Ida Twitter Activity") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  ) +
  xlim(-96, -67) +
  ylim(24, 47)
```

## Spatial Cluster Analysis

### Create Spatial Weight Matrix

Use 110km Euclidean distance and include self in the weight matrix

```{r spatial-weight-matrix, warning = FALSE}
county_coords <- counties %>%
  st_centroid() %>% # convert polygons to centroid points
  st_coordinates() # convert to simple x,y coordinates to play with stdep

thresdist <- county_coords %>% 
  dnearneigh(0, 110, longlat = TRUE) %>% # use geodesic distance of 110km
  # distance should be long enough for every feature to have >= one neighbor
  include.self() # include a county in its own neighborhood (for G*)

thresdist # view statistical summary of the nearest neighbors
```

Optionally, plot the spatial weight matrix results
This should result in a very dense graph, because each county is connected
to all other counties within 110 km.

```{r plot-spatial-weight-matrix}
plot(thresdist, county_coords, lwd=0.1) # plot nearest neighbor ties
```

## Calculate Getis-Ord G* Statistic

```{r getis-ord}
# Create weight matrix from the neighbor objects
dwm <- nb2listw(thresdist, zero.policy = T)

# Get Ord G* statistic for hot and cold spots
counties$locG <- counties$tweetrate %>% 
  localG(listw = dwm, zero.policy = TRUE) %>% 
  as.vector()

# check summary statistics of the local G score
summary(counties$locG)
```

## Map Hotpots

classify G scores by significance values typical of Z-scores
where 1.15 is at the 0.125 confidence level,
and 1.95 is at the 0.05 confidence level for two tailed z-scores
based on Getis and Ord (1995) Doi: 10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x
to find other critical values, use the qnorm() function as shown here:
https://methodenlehre.github.io/SGSCLM-R-course/statistical-distributions.html
Getis Ord also suggest applying a Bonferroni correction 

breaks and colors from http://michaelminn.net/tutorials/r-point-analysis/
based on 1.96 as the 95% confidence interval for z-scores
if your results don't have values in each of the 5 categories, you may need
to change the values & labels accordingly.

Can we figure out a way to include the neighborhood surrounding each significant
cluster?

```{r map-hotspots}
# classify by significance levels
siglevel <- c(1.15, 1.95)
counties <- counties %>%
  mutate(sig = cut(locG, c(
    min(counties$locG),
    siglevel[2] * -1,
    siglevel[1] * -1,
    siglevel[1],
    siglevel[2],
    max(counties$locG)
  )))
rm(siglevel)

# map results!
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = counties, aes(fill = sig), color = "white", lwd = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("#0000FF80", "#8080FF80", "#FFFFFF80", "#FF808080", "#FF000080"),
    labels = c("low", "", "insignificant", "", "high"),
    aesthetics = "fill"
  ) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Hot Spots")) +
  labs(title = "Clusters of Hurricane event Twitter Activity") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank()
  )
```
